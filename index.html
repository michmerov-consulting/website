								loaded in the user's browser.</mark>
						</p>
						<p>User Management Amazon Cognito provides user management and
							authentication functions to secure the backend API.</p>
						<p>Serverless Backend Amazon DynamoDB provides a persistence
							layer where data can be stored by the API's Lambda function.</p>
						<p>RESTful API JavaScript executed in the browser sends and
							receives data from a public backend API built using Lambda and
							API Gateway.</p>

					costs you money until you open the s3 bucket to the public. Even
					after you open the bucket to the public, no one knows about it and
					the % chance costs goes over $1 is extremely low. When Amazon's s3
					bucket console asks you to confirm making the bucket public, feel
					free to do so with confidence.

						5. Enable Website Hosting</q> contains an important 'aside', which
					most people reading this review will need to follow. I had to in
					creating this site. I'm referring to the following paragraph:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>You can also use a custom domain for your website. For
						example http://www.wildrydes.com is hosted on S3. Setting up a
						custom domain is not covered in this workshop, but you can find
						detailed instructions in our documentation.</p>

				</blockquote>
				<p>
					No one should register http://<i>your-name</i>.<b>s3-website</b>.<i>your-region</i>.<b>amazonaws.com</b>
					with Google's search engine. If someone did register that url with
					Google's search engine, then don't worry, no one would shop there.
					No one would think that url represents a real business.

				<h2>How was this site made?</h2>
				<p>We followed Amazon's documentation, This article will turn
					into a blow by blow accounting of following those Amazon documents
					with the intent to give "where's my wallet/purse" confidence to you
					the reader that cloud sales personnel commonly fail to instill
					during their pitch.</p>
